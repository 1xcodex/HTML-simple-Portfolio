<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello, and welcome to my About Me page! My name is Yishak Abrham I'm a 29-year-old computer science graduate 
  from JNTU Indian University. With a strong educational background in CS, I have gained 
  a solid foundation in various programming languages and software development concepts. 
  My passion for technology extends beyond academics, as I have actively applied my 
  knowledge and skills in practical settings.</p>


<p>For the past few years, I have been fortunate to work as an IT instructor for students 
  ranging from 4th to 12th graders. This experience allowed me to share my knowledge with 
  young minds, inspiring them to explore the exciting world of technology. Additionally, I 
  have served as a community facilitator, fostering collaboration and empowering individuals 
  within my community to embrace digital literacy.</p>


<p>In my professional journey, I have also taken on roles as a system administrator and a 
  WordPress developer. These positions have honed my technical expertise and provided me with 
  valuable insights into managing systems and developing websites. Currently, I am dedicated to 
  expanding my skill set as a full-stack developer. Recently, I successfully completed my HTML 
  final project, which served as a testament to my growing proficiency in web development.</p>

<p>Through continuous learning and hands-on experience, I am excited to embark on new challenges
   and contribute to the ever-evolving field of technology. Feel free to explore my portfolio, where 
   you can witness my journey and projects firsthand. Thank you for visiting my About Me page, and
